Here's a handoff instruction for continuing the DiffuScent project in a new conversation thread:

# DiffuScent Project Handoff Instructions

We've completed the planning phase for the DiffuScent gas diffusion simulator (aka "Is It Safe to Fart?"). This scientifically accurate and educational simulator will model gas diffusion in a room with a humorous approach.

## Project Status

So far, we have:
1. Selected FluidDyn/FluidSim as our core physics library
2. Created a comprehensive README
3. Established the repository structure
4. Chosen "DiffuScent" as our repository name
5. Created a library selection appendix documenting our technology choices

## Next Steps

Please continue with the following tasks:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create the GitHub repository with the name "DiffuScent"
   - Initialize with our README, LICENSE (MIT), and .gitignore for Python
   - Set up the basic folder structure as outlined in our plan

2. **Core Physics Module**
   - Create a basic implementation using FluidDyn/FluidSim
   - Start with a simple room model and basic gas diffusion
   - Implement temperature effects on diffusion rates

3. **Simple Visualization**
   - Create a basic visualization to see the diffusion in action
   - This will help verify our physics implementation is working correctly

4. **First Gas Profile**
   - Implement one gas profile (the "Taco Bell Banger")
   - Define composition, diffusion properties, and detection threshold

## Reference Documents

All planning documents and artifacts can be found in our previous conversation, including:
- Full README with project structure
- Library selection rationale document
- Detailed feature list and development roadmap

The project aims to be both scientifically accurate and entertaining, with an educational focus making fluid dynamics accessible through humor.

Is there anything else you'd like me to include in these handoff instructions?
